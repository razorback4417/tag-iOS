#  Tag
A social rideshare platform with sustainable rewards.

Tag allows you to find other students going to the same place at the same time. Students will gain 3 main things out of Tag:
1) cheaper Lyft/Ubers
2) easy and automated payment splitting with people you share a trip with
3) discounts/rewards to local resturants for using the app

Tag is set to launch Fall 2024 at UCLA.

Coming Soon:
- mapbox implementation
- message groupchats with stream
- verification
- simplify registration
